Bourne shell − If you are using a Bourne-type shell, the $ character is the default prompt.
Bourne shell is usually installed as /bin/sh on most versions of Unix. For this reason, it is the
shell of choice for writing scripts that can be used on different versions of Unix.

Assume we create a test.sh script. Note all the scripts would have the .sh extension. Before you add
anything else to your script, you need to alert the system that a shell script is being started. This is
done using the shebang construct. For example −
#!/bin/sh
This tells the system that the commands that follow are to be executed by the Bourne shell. It's called a
shebang because the # symbol is called a hash, and the ! symbol is called a bang.
To create a script containing these commands, you put the shebang line first and then add the commands −
#!/bin/bash
pwd
ls
